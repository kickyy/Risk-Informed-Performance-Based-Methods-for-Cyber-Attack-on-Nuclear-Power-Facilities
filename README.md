RAVEN Scripts folder contain all the XML files used to produce the results of the assocaited research paper.
ADAPT Files folder contain the RELAP5 model, and the ADAPT specific files (branching rules file and template simulator input file) necessary to provide to the ADAPT server.

In order for these scripts to work, the RAVEN and ADAPT software packages need to be downloaded and installed (they are open source and provided by INL and SNL, respectively). 
These files may then be provided to those software packages to reproduce the results of the research.
